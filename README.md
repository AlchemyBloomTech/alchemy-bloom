Alchemy Bloom is a personal reflection gallery app designed and developed by Gabriela Orellana. It’s a full-stack web application inspired by spiritual transformation, inner growth, and the journey of renewal.

Built with Java, Spring Boot, Typescript, React, Docker, and SQLite, Alchemy Bloom blends secure development, clean design, and faith to create a safe, uplifting space for personal reflection.

This project is a testament to self-learning and creativity — where technology meets artistry, and every feature reflects a passion for continuous growth, exploration, and transformation.

✨ “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”
— Romans 12:2
